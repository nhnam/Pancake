Upgrading to Pancake 1.3

There are two compatibility changes in Pancake 1.3 that should be noted.

First, Pancake does not work with PHP 5.3 anymore. Please upgrade to PHP 5.4.
Debian 6.0 Squeeze users may install a newer version of PHP from the dotdeb repository: http://www.dotdeb.org/
See "instructions" on their web page for more information.

Second, if you are using a custom exception page handler you should make sure not to use Pancake\HTTPRequest::$answerCodes anymore.
This will cause a crash. Instead you may get the string corresponding to an answer code using the new Pancake\HTTPRequest::getAnswerCodeString()
function. Example:

Instead of calling
  HTTPRequest::$answerCodes[$exception->getCode()]
you should use
  HTTPRequest::getAnswerCodeString($exception->getCode())

That's all. In case you have further questions, please don't hesitate to contact support@pancakehttp.net. :-)

Have fun with Pancake 1.3!
