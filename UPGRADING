Upgrading to Pancake 1.4

Some default configuration values have changed in Pancake 1.4. Please look at the changelog for further information. It is especially 
recommended to disable PHP wait slots (main.waitSlotWaitLimit = 0) when upgrading from older Pancake versions since those are not needed 
in most cases.

The former vHost setting "writeLimit" has been moved to the "main" configuration section. For compatibility, Pancake looks up the highest 
"writeLimit" value from all vHosts and uses this one if it's higher than the "main.writeLimit" value. It is recommended to remove the 
"writeLimit" setting from all vHosts and set a new, reasonable value in the "main" configuration. The new default value for "main.writeLimit" 
is 1048576.

Please note that the "filter" extension binary MUST be called exactly "filter.so" if loaded as a dynamic vHost PHP module. Other extensions are 
not affected by this limitation.

Enjoy your tasty Pancake 1.4!

Upgrading to Pancake 1.3

There are two compatibility changes in Pancake 1.3 that should be noted.

First, Pancake does not work with PHP 5.3 anymore. Please upgrade to PHP 5.4.
Debian 6.0 Squeeze users may install a newer version of PHP from the dotdeb repository: http://www.dotdeb.org/
See "instructions" on their web page for more information.

Second, if you are using a custom exception page handler you should make sure not to use Pancake\HTTPRequest::$answerCodes anymore.
This will cause a crash. Instead you may get the string corresponding to an answer code using the new Pancake\HTTPRequest::getAnswerCodeString()
function. Example:

Instead of calling
  HTTPRequest::$answerCodes[$exception->getCode()]
you should use
  HTTPRequest::getAnswerCodeString($exception->getCode())

That's all. In case you have further questions, please don't hesitate to contact support@pancakehttp.net. :-)

Have fun with Pancake 1.3!
